  # Fix infinite recursion in profiles RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - Current RLS policies on profiles table cause infinite recursion
    - Policies are querying the profiles table from within the policy conditions
    - This creates a circular dependency when checking permissions

  2. Solution
    - Drop existing problematic policies
    - Create new policies that don't reference the profiles table within conditions
    - Use auth.uid() directly for user identification
    - Simplify admin access by using auth metadata or separate approach

  3. New Policies
    - Users can view their own profile: auth.uid() = id
    - Users can update their own profile: auth.uid() = id
    - For admin access, we'll use a simpler approach initially

-- Drop existing policies that cause recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON profiles;

-- Create new non-recursive policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile"
  ON profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON profiles
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile"
  ON profiles
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- For admin functionality, we'll handle this at the application level
-- or create a separate admin check that doesn't cause recursion
-- This policy allows admins to view all profiles by checking a specific email domain
-- You can modify this condition based on your admin identification strategy
CREATE POLICY "Service role can manage all profiles"
  ON profiles
  FOR ALL
  TO service_role
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
